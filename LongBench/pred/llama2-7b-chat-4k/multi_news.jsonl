The results showed that the most important person in the world is actually Carl Linnaeus, a 18th-century Swedish naturalist, rather than the more commonly expected figures such as Michael Jackson or Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe study also found that each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, which means that the most important historical figures are born in Western countries after the 17th century and are male.

To get around this issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance, called CheiRank, which takes into account the number of outgoing links from an article.\n\nIn addition to the study on Wikipedia, the Internet Archive is also working to fix broken links on the web by crawling supported \"No More 404\" sites and archiving pages as they are created.

The CDC has reported that the number of cases has risen steadily since April, with most cases occurring between August and December. The cause of AFM remains unknown, but some physicians believe it may be linked to enterovirus D68, which was identified in some cases of AFM in 2014.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth and found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse. This finding adds to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation also found that the angle at which gravity pulls blood dripping from a body on the shroud varies with the body part, with some bloodstains tracing angles at odds with each other. The study's findings are consistent with the idea that the shroud is not a genuine religious relic, but rather a medieval artistic or didactic representation. The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a religious relic, and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. The controversy surrounding the shroud's authenticity has been ongoing for centuries, with some people believing it to be the burial cloth of Jesus, while others consider it to be a medieval forgery.

Rowling has founded the organization Lumos, which aims to shed light on the lives of these children and work towards eradicating institutionalization by 2050. The campaign has received support from international donors and has achieved significant reductions in the number of children in institutions in several countries. Rowling has also committed to becoming the president of Lumos for life, and has called on others to join the campaign and help create a world where no child is taken from their family and locked away.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them. Rowling wants to change that, not by improving these orphanages with \"pretty murals\" or teddy bears, but by eliminating them altogether, she writes in the Guardian. The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2416}

{"pred": " In a recent discovery, scientists have found a new species of theropod dinosaur in China, which they have named Caihong juji. This dinosaur lived around 161 million years ago during the Jurassic period and had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were found to have pancake-shaped melanosomes, which are responsible for pigmentation, and the colors were observed to shift and change depending on the angle of light. The discovery of Caihong suggests that the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs may have been more colorful than previously thought, and that the display of these feathers may have played a role in mating and social interactions. Additionally, the discovery of Caihong provides evidence that the evolution of flight in birds may have originated from the display of feathers rather than the actual act of flying.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

A woman in Central California, Myrna Arias, was fired from her job at Intermex Wire Transfer LLC after she refused to install an app that tracked her location even when she was off the clock. The app, provided by Xora, Inc., contained a GPS function that allowed her boss to monitor her location 24/7. Arias objected to the app, citing privacy concerns, and was subsequently fired.\n2. Intermex required Arias and several other employees to install the app, which was marketed as a time-tracking tool. However, the app also tracked the employees' locations even when they were not working.\n3. Arias' boss, John Stubits, admitted that the company was monitoring employees' locations while off duty and claimed that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments even after she installed the app.\n4. Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that the app was an invasion of privacy and that Intermex had no legitimate business interest in monitoring employees' locations outside of work hours.\n5. Intermex fired Arias a few weeks after she uninstalled the app to protect her privacy. The company also allegedly interfered with Arias' ability to earn a livelihood by informing her employer at NetSpend Corporation that she had been disloyal.\n6. Arias is seeking an injunction and damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination, and unfair business practices.\n\nOverall, the news passages highlight the ongoing debate between employee privacy and employer monitoring.

Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

The White House has also made it clear that it will not gut or delay the health law, and President Barack Obama has the power to veto any bill that does so.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The probe will be equipped with instruments to study the physical processes occurring in the solar wind and will make 24 orbits of the sun, with the closest approach being within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface. The mission will provide insight into the physics of stars, improve forecasting of major space weather events, and change our understanding of the sun.

The results showed that the most important person in the world is actually Carl Linnaeus, a 18th-century Swedish naturalist, rather than the more commonly expected figures such as Michael Jackson or Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe study also found that each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, which means that the most important historical figures are born in Western countries after the 17th century and are male. However, the study also showed that the algorithm was thrown off by a quirk of Wikipedia, as Linnaeus' life work was coming up with a system to classify organisms, and applying that system as widely as possible, which led to a lot of named species being linked to him. To get around this issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance, called CheiRank, which takes into account the number of outgoing links from an article.\n\nIn addition to the study on Wikipedia, the Internet Archive is also working to fix broken links on the web by crawling supported \"No More 404\" sites and archiving pages as they are created.

Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The CDC has reported that the number of cases has risen steadily since April, with most cases occurring between August and December. The cause of AFM remains unknown, but some physicians believe it may be linked to enterovirus D68, which was identified in some cases of AFM in 2014.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth and found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse. This finding adds to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation also found that the angle at which gravity pulls blood dripping from a body on the shroud varies with the body part, with some bloodstains tracing angles at odds with each other. The study's findings are consistent with the idea that the shroud is not a genuine religious relic, but rather a medieval artistic or didactic representation. The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a religious relic, and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it.

This dinosaur lived around 161 million years ago during the Jurassic period and had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were found to have pancake-shaped melanosomes, which are responsible for pigmentation, and the colors were observed to shift and change depending on the angle of light. The discovery of Caihong suggests that the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs may have been more colorful than previously thought, and that the display of these feathers may have played a role in mating and social interactions. Additionally, the discovery of Caihong provides evidence that the evolution of flight in birds may have originated from the display of feathers rather than the actual act of flying.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

A woman in Central California, Myrna Arias, was fired from her job at Intermex Wire Transfer LLC after she refused to install an app that tracked her location even when she was off the clock. The app, provided by Xora, Inc., contained a GPS function that allowed her boss to monitor her location 24/7. Arias objected to the app, citing privacy concerns, and was subsequently fired.\n2. Intermex required Arias and several other employees to install the app, which was marketed as a time-tracking tool. However, the app also tracked the employees' locations even when they were not working.\n3. Arias' boss, John Stubits, admitted that the company was monitoring employees' locations while off duty and claimed that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments even after she installed the app.\n4. Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that the app was an invasion of privacy and that Intermex had no legitimate business interest in monitoring employees' locations outside of work hours.\n5. Intermex fired Arias a few weeks after she uninstalled the app to protect her privacy. The company also allegedly interfered with Arias' ability to earn a livelihood by informing her employer at NetSpend Corporation that she had been disloyal.\n6. Arias is seeking an injunction and damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination, and unfair business practices.\n\nOverall, the news passages highlight the ongoing debate between employee privacy and employer monitoring.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The film is based on the true events and tries to tell the story without taking a nice or pretty approach. It is a visceral and harrowing experience that begins with the history of black people in the United States, including the Great Migration and white flight, leading to the overcrowding of black residents in urban pockets. The film then focuses on the events leading up to the riots, including a police raid on an unlicensed nightclub and the arrest of black partygoers. The stomach-churning horror begins immediately and does not let up for 2 hours and 23 minutes, with no reprieve. The film addresses the systemic oppression and mistreatment of black people in the United States and the police brutality that led to the Algiers Motel siege. It also shows the aftermath of the siege, including the trial of the three officers involved and the impact on the community. The film is controversial and has been criticized for its portrayal of police brutality and its lack of judgment. However, it is also praised for its immersion and its ability to get under the viewer's skin.

According to a new paper by Dan Hooper, harvesting energy from distant stars is not only the best way to increase a civilization's available resources but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization totally alone in the vastness of space. The paper proposes that advanced civilizations would reel in stars from other galaxies and harness their energy before those stars become inaccessible forever.\n\nThe articles also mention the three types of galactic expansion proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, which include harvesting all of a planet's resources (Type I), all of a star's energy (Type II), and all the resources of a galaxy (Type III). The possibility of detecting advanced alien civilizations through their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation, is also discussed.\n\nAdditionally, the articles touch on the concept of Dyson spheres, which are swarms of satellites that could be used to harness a star's energy. The idea of Dyson spheres has been proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson and featured in science fiction works such as \"Star Maker\" by Olaf Stapledon and \"Ringworld\" by Larry Niven.\n\nOverall, the news articles suggest that the search for advanced alien civilizations may involve looking for unusual light signatures in the light of distant galaxies, as well as considering the possibility of energy harvesting from distant stars and the use of Dyson spheres.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The discovery includes the use of obsidian tools, pigment lumps, and standardized Middle Stone Age tools, indicating technological advancements and social networking among early human populations. The research also suggests that early Homo sapiens and their close relatives evolved to deal with constantly changing environments, and that factors other than climate fluctuations may have spurred ancient tool innovations. The findings are published in three papers in Science magazine and provide strong indicators that early Homo sapiens were well on their way to becoming modern humans in Africa by around 300,000 years ago.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, a Jewish human rights organization, has called on the Canadian government to take action against Katriuk and hold him accountable for his alleged crimes.\n4. In 1999, the Federal Court of Canada ruled that Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretenses by not disclosing his collaboration with the Nazis, but found insufficient evidence to prosecute him.\n5. In 2007, the Harper cabinet decided not to revoke Katriuk's citizenship, despite ongoing calls for his deportation.\n6. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress has urged the Canadian government to ignore Russia's demands regarding Katriuk, citing a previous finding by the Federal Court that found no evidence of his participation in war crimes.\n7.

The new law makes possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana a petty offense that can result in a fine, rather than criminal charges. The law also permits the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The legislation paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp. The move comes after decades of debate and follows changes to drug laws in U.S. states. Jamaica's national security minister, Peter Bunting, said the legislation does not mean Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. The law also allows for the licensing of a cannabis licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. The Rastafarian spiritual movement can now freely use marijuana for sacramental purposes for the first time on the island. The move by Jamaican lawmakers adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 U.S. states allow some form of medical marijuana, and last year Colorado and Washington legalized personal use. On Tuesday, Alaska became the third U.S. state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana for adults.

A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement.
